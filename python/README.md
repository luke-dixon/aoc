# My Python AOC solutions

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in Python.

Install the requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

These can be run from this directory like:

```
python -m y2019.d05 -f /path/to/input.txt
```

Alternatively you can export `AOC_SESSION` to retrieve the input data.
```
python -m y2019.d15
```

Run tests for a day (not all days have tests):
```
python -m unittest discover -v y2019.d01
```
