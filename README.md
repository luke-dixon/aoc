# My AOC solutions

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

For the first commit for each solution it is as close to what got me the solution as I have.
Some of them I just played around inside the Python interpreter, so those ones are especially ugly :)

## 2019

Install the requirements:

```
pip install -r 2019/requirements.txt
```

These can be run from this directory like:

```
python -m 2019.05 -f /path/to/input.txt
```

Alternatively you can export `AOC_SESSION` to retrieve the input data.
```
python -m 2019.15
```

Run tests for a day (not all days have tests):
```
python -m unittest discover -v 2019.01
```

## 2017-2018

These are in individual directories and you run them individually. They open an input file with the data in it which you will need to supply yourself.
