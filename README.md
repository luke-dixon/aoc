# My AOC solutions

All of these are ugly and bad. Don't look at them please.

For the first commit for each solution it is as close to what got me the solution as I have.
Some of them I just played around inside the Python interpreter, so those ones are especially ugly.

## 2019

Install the requirements:

```
pip install -r 2019/requirements.txt
```

These can be run from this directory like:

```
python -m 2019.15
```

You'll need to export `AOC_SESSION` to retrieve the input data.

## 2017-2018

These are in individual directories and you run them individually. They open an input file with the data in it which you will need to supply yourself.
